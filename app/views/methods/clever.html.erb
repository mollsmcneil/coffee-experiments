  <p>
  	To get back some of the fullness of taste of a Cafetière while still retaining some of the delicate flavours exposed by a pour-over you can use the Clever. The gadget, highly deserving of its name, combines the full immersion method with the filtering through a paper filter resulting in a pleasant balance of a rich body without getting overwhelmed by the grind texture.
